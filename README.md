## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was quite interesting, most of it was pretty standard card creation, but the challenge was to center the svg without it being cropped. Also the hover effects where really interesting to make. Good project overall.

### Continued development

I'm looking to improve my skills on HTML5 and CSS3 even further, more likely on Flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

Most of what I learned, I learned from these 3 resources:

- [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) - Perfect place to learn a lot about web development in general, extremely recommended.
- [Kevin Powell Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - The king of CSS, he has really useful videos and courses about HTML and CSS.
- [Web Dev Simplified Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified/videos) - Great Youtube Channel to learn about web development.
